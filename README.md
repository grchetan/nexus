## 💡 Why I Built This

> *"The best way to learn full-stack development is not to follow tutorials — it's to build something real, break it, fix it, and ship it."*

I built **Nexus** because I wanted a project that wasn't just a single page or a single feature — but a **complete, production-ready product** I could genuinely be proud of.

My goals going in:

- Write **everything myself** — frontend to backend, no shortcuts
- Build a **real authentication system** using JWT that survives browser refreshes
- Practice **file uploads, database modeling, and REST API design** all in one project
- Create something that looks and feels genuinely **professional**

Nexus is inspired by LinkedIn — but every single line of code is my own.

---

## 🚀 What is Nexus?

**Nexus is a full-stack professional networking platform** where users can:

| Feature | What you can do |
|---|---|
| 🔐 Auth | Create an account and log in — session stays active even after page refresh |
| 👤 Profile | Upload your photo, cover image, add skills and work experience |
| 📝 Feed | Share posts — with text, images, or videos |
| ❤️ Like & Comment | React to other people's posts |
| 💬 Messages | Chat with your connections in real time |
| 🤝 Connect | Send and accept connection requests |
| 🔔 Notifications | Get alerts for likes, connections, and job matches |
| 💼 Jobs | Browse job listings and apply directly |
| 🔍 Search | Find any user by name |
| 📱 Mobile Ready | Works perfectly on both phones and desktops |

## 🧠 Tech Stack — And Why I Chose It

### Frontend
```
React 18     →  Component-based UI — makes the app modular and maintainable
Vite         →  Lightning-fast build tool with instant hot reload in development
Context API  →  Global state management (user session, notifications, page routing)
CSS Variables → Consistent design system — theming without any extra library
```

### Backend
```
Node.js + Express  →  Lightweight REST API server — fast and flexible
MongoDB + Mongoose →  Document-based database — flexible schema for evolving data
JWT                →  Token-based auth — stateless, secure, survives page refreshes
Multer             →  Handles photo and video file uploads on the server
Bcryptjs           →  Password hashing — plain text passwords are never stored
Nodemon            →  Auto-restarts the server on every file save during development
```

### Why the MERN Stack?

1. **One language everywhere** — JavaScript on both frontend and backend
2. **MongoDB's flexible schema** keeps the codebase clean as the app evolves
3. **React + Vite** is the fastest developer experience available in 2024
4. **MERN developers are in high demand** across the industry

## ⚙️ Running It Locally — Step by Step

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js v18+](https://nodejs.org)
- [MongoDB Community](https://mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

---

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nexus-app.git
cd nexus-app
```

---

### Step 2 — Create the backend `.env` file

Navigate into the `backend/` folder and create a file named `.env`, then paste this:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/nexus_db
JWT_SECRET=any_long_random_string_you_choose
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

> ⚠️ Never push your `.env` file to GitHub — it contains your secret keys.

---

### Step 3 — Install all dependencies

```bash
# Root
npm install

# Backend
cd backend && npm install && cd ..

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

---

### Step 4 — Start MongoDB

```bash
mongod
```

---

### Step 5 — Start the app (2 terminals)

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend
cd backend
npm run dev
```

```bash
# Terminal 2 — Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

---

### ✅ You're all set! Open these in your browser:

| | URL |
|---|---|
| 🌐 App | `http://localhost:5173` |
| 🔧 API | `http://localhost:5000` |
| ❤️ Health Check | `http://localhost:5000/api/health` |

> 💡 **Live reload is already configured.** Save any file in `backend/` and the server restarts automatically. Save any file in `frontend/` and the browser updates instantly — no manual restarts needed.

## 🎯 What I Learned Building This

This project is where I stopped just reading about concepts and actually applied them:

- ✅ **JWT Authentication** — full flow from signup to protected routes
- ✅ **REST API Design** — clean endpoints with proper HTTP methods and status codes
- ✅ **MongoDB Schema Design** — modeling relationships between Users and Posts
- ✅ **File Upload Handling** — Multer with profile photos, cover images, and post media
- ✅ **React Context API** — global state management without Redux overhead
- ✅ **Component Architecture** — building reusable, readable UI components
- ✅ **CSS Design System** — consistent theming using CSS custom properties
- ✅ **Responsive Design** — mobile and desktop layouts from a single codebase
- ✅ **Error Handling** — graceful errors on both the frontend and backend
